# Request

The req object represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on. In this documentation and by convention, the object is always referred to as req (and the HTTP response is res) but its actual name is determined by the parameters to the callback function in which you’re working

For example:

```js filename="app.js" copy
app.get("/user/:id", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`user ${req.params.id}`);
});
```

But you could just as well have:

```js filename="app.js" copy
app.get("/user/:id", (request, response) => {
  response.send(`user ${request.params.id}`);
});
```

The req object is an enhanced version of Node’s own request object and supports all built-in fields and methods.
