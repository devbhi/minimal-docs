## Methods

### minimaal.json([options])

This is a built-in middleware function in Minimaal. It parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based on body-parser.

Returns middleware that only parses JSON and only looks at requests where the Content-Type header matches the type option. This parser accepts any Unicode encoding of the body and supports automatic inflation of gzip and deflate encodings.

A new body object containing the parsed data is populated on the request object after the middleware (i.e. req.body), or an empty object ({}) if there was no body to parse, the Content-Type was not matched, or an error occurred.

The following table describes the properties of the optional options object.

### minimaal.urlencoded([options])

This is a built-in middleware function in Minimaal. It parses incoming requests with urlencoded payloads and is based on body-parser.

Returns middleware that only parses urlencoded bodies and only looks at requests where the Content-Type header matches the type option. This parser accepts only UTF-8 encoding of the body and supports automatic inflation of gzip and deflate encodings.

A new body object containing the parsed data is populated on the request object after the middleware (i.e. req.body), or an empty object ({}) if there was no body to parse, the Content-Type was not matched, or an error occurred. This object will contain key-value pairs, where the value can be a string or array (when extended is false), or any type (when extended is true).

The following table describes the properties of the optional options object.
| Property | Description | Type | Default |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------- | :------------------------------ |
| extended | This option allows to choose between parsing the URL-encoded data with the querystring library (when false) or the qs library (when true). The “extended” syntax allows for rich objects and arrays to be encoded into the URL-encoded format, allowing for a JSON-like experience with URL-encoded. For more information, please see the qs library. | Boolean | false |
| inflate | Enables or disables handling deflated (compressed) bodies; when disabled, deflated bodies are rejected. | Boolean | true |
| limit | Controls the maximum request body size. If this is a number, then the value specifies the number of bytes; if it is a string, the value is passed to the bytes library for parsing. | Mixed | "100kb" |
| parameterLimit | This option controls the maximum number of parameters that are allowed in the URL-encoded data. If a request contains more parameters than this value, an error will be raised. | Number | 1000 |
| type | This is used to determine what media type the middleware will parse. This option can be a string, array of strings, or a function. If not a function, type option is passed directly to the type-is library and this can be an extension name (like urlencoded), a mime type (like application/x-www-form-urlencoded), or a mime type with a wildcard (like \*/x-www-form-urlencoded). If a function, the type option is called as fn(req) and the request is parsed if it returns a truthy value. | Mixed | "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" |
| verify | This option, if supplied, is called as verify(req, res, buf, encoding), where buf is a Buffer of the raw request body and encoding is the encoding of the request. The parsing can be aborted by throwing an error. | Function | undefined |
